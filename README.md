# Working with Deck.gl to create various GeoJSON maps for a tech talk at work

## Data - 
- All data is downloaded from [US Census](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2021&layergroup=Census+Tracts)
- The data must be then be converted into a [GeoJson format](https://geojson.org/) using a shapefile conversion.
- You need at least the **.dbf** and **.shp** files, and if available, also the **.shx** and **.prj** files for a proper conversion
- Site I used for conversion is [MapShaper](https://mapshaper.org/)
